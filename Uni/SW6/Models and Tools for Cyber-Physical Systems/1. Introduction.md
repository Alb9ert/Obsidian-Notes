## Cyber-Physical Systems

>[!tip] Definition
>Interacts with the real world, has a computational aspect, and does something physical.
>
>**Ambiguous definition:**
>Are robot vacuums Cyber-Physical systems?
>
>Do they **need to be safety critical?**

* Always has an interface => input and output

- Traditional computers: Standalone devices with running software
- Traditional controllers: devices that interacts with the physical world (sensors and actuators)
- Embedded systems: devices with integrated microcontrollers/systems
- Break down components into sub-tasks in the system to make it more manageable 

### Example systems
- Driverless cars
- Medical devices
- Coordinating robots

# Model based design
* Firstly gather requirements
* Decide on components and then decompose each component in subcomponents
* Followed by making state diagrams based on i/o

## Capturing Requirements

A mathematically precise description of what a system is supposed to do.

**Writing requirements is key to ensuring reliability of systems**.

>[!info] Example - Cruise Control
>- Requirement 1: Actual speed *eventually* converges to desired speed
>- Requirement 2: Speed of the car stays "stable"

## Formal Verification

- **Goal**: Establish that model satisfies requirements under all possible scenarios
- **Fist challenge;** Need at formal definition 
- **Second challen**
