# Model Based Design

> *Fig: Block diagram dummy example (widely used in industrial design)*

### Functional Computation
- Basic function
- Given inputs, it gives output
- Example: Turing machine, lambda calculus
### Reactive Computation
- System interacts with its environment via inputs and outputs in an ongoing manner
- Example: Cruise controller
### Sequential Computation
- A computation is a sequence of instructions executed one at a time
### Concurrent Computation
- Multiple components/processes exchanging information and evolving concurrently
- Logical vs physical concurrency
	- Logical and physical move simultaneously (When physical change happen, logically it should also change)

# Synchronous Model
All components execute in a sequence of rounds in lock-step

## Delay Component

![[Pasted image 20260203135736.png]]	![[Pasted image 20260203135718.png]]Each state is represented by the state variable value
Every component executes/computes at a given time (the clock tick)

### [[Mind 2.0/SW6/Models and Tools for Cyber-Physical Systems/Synchronous Reactive Component|Synchronous Reactive Components]] (SRC)
In general Synchronous Reactive Component (SRC) is represented by a block with a state variable and update code
### Synchronous Time-triggered Communication
Time is divided into slots
At each clock tick excactly one component sends a message over the bus for a new component to execute

### Multiple Reactions

#### Blocking

## [[Executions]]
## Semantic Equivalence

If both have identical sets of reactions, they are considered to have **Semantic Equivalence**.
