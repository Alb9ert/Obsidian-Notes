> A common example is a vehicle’s cruise control system. For instance, when a vehicle encounters a hill, its speed will decrease if the engine power output is kept constant. The PID controller adjusts the engine's power output to restore the vehicle to its desired speed, doing so efficiently with minimal delay and overshoot.
