# More on turing machines
To show a language is computable => find one (any kind of) DTM that accepts the language and rejects if not part of language
### Input alphabet $\Sigma$
The **input alphabet** is the set of symbols that can appear in the **original input string**.

### Tape alphabet $\Gamma$
The **tape alphabet** is the set of all symbols that can appear on the tape during computation.
Extra symbols used in machine like **blank**
### Zeno machine / hypercomputer
Theoritical.
Can perform **infinitely many steps in a finite amount of time**.

- Step 1 takes **1/2 second**
- Step 2 takes **1/4 second**
- Step 3 takes **1/8 second**
- Step 4 takes **1/16 second**

### Turing completeness
A formalization of computation is Turing-complete, if it can simulate every Turing machine.
Most programming languages are **Turing** **complete** like python, c, java, pseudomat, ...
Needs a while loop

MINECRAFT IS TURING COMPLETE

### Church Turing-Thesis
>[!quote] Everything that can be computed, can be computed by a Turing machine

>[!important] Important
>We will use the direction 0 (stay on cell) from now on in our Turing machines
>Whenever it is convient. 0 means staying the head at the same symbol on the tape

# Multi-Tape Turing Machines
Uses multiple tapes for a turing machine and each tape acts independently.

Copied second part to bottom tape

The tuple remains the same from "normal" turing machines except we alter the transition function:
$$δ : (Q \backslash \{t, r \}) × Γ^k → Q × Γ^k × \{−1, +1\}^k$$

**Configuration**: one state and k tapes with k (independent) heads

**Initial configuration**: Input word on first tape, all other tapes empty

**Successor configuration**: update state, update current cell on each tape, move head on each tape

>[!important] Important
>For every multi tape DTM there exists an equvailient single tape DTM

# Nondeterministic Turing Machines
**Formal definition:** Only thing that changes is the format of the transition function
$$δ : (Q \backslash \{t, r \}) × Γ → 2^{Q×Γ×\{−1,+1\}}.$$

>[!important] Important
> For every NTM there exists an equvailient DTM

For it to accept the at least one run of the word must be accepting

>[!info] Definition - Halting NTM
> A NTM M is a halting NTM, if for every input, the computation tree of M on w is finite.

## Exercises:

### Test your understanding
1. An NTM M accepts input w if there exists more than one computation of M on w such that M halts in the state t.
False can also just have one computation that halts in state t

2. An NTM M accepts input w if no computation of M on w halts in the state r.

3. An NTM M accepts input w if there exists a computation of M on w such that M halts in the state t.

4. An NTM M accepts input w if there is exactly one accepting computation of M on w.

5. An NTM M accepts input w if for every computation of M on w we have that M halts in state t.
